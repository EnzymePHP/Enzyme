				Welcome to Enzyme! Enzyme is an extremely lightweight PHP framework that allows you to
				create applications extremely quickly, with easy to read code. Enzyme provides numerous
				features to help you create these applications such as routing, controllers, models
				and database support. Use this guide to help you get started writing some awesome 
				Enzyme applications.

				<h3>Installing</h3>
				Installing Enzyme is extremely easy. All you need to do is download Enzyme here. Once
				you have downloaded Enzyme, unzip it into the root directory of your project and work
				from there.

				<h3>Routing</h3>
				Enzyme has made it so that you don't have to do any routing calls yourself. Instead,
				your route will just call upon the controller and controller method that you have set
				in your url, as well as pass any parameters in your further url components. Because we
				have to use our controller in order to point to our views, we will talk about controllers
				next. Don't worry, they are very simple to use, but before we can do that, we must configure
				out htaccess to rewrite to the correct url, because Enzyme doesn't know the url that
				you are going to be hosting your application on whenever it is installed. In order to do this,
				navigate to the "public" directory and open up the ".htaccess" file. In this file,
				on line 4, replace the words "/enzyme-dev/public" with your sub-url, followed by "/public".
				However, this is not required if you are just using your domain name. You will only need
				to include the sub-url if you are requiring your users to go to type "public" into their
				browser, but that would be bad. So for example, if your user is traveling to 
				"yourdomain.com", ideally, the public folder would be accessed by landing on that page.
				If that is the case for you, then you can just delete the line and continue with routing 
				normally. If you are still confused, then you check out <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritebase">this</a> 
				page for more information about rewriting URLs (specifically the "RewriteBase" directive).

				<h3>Controllers and Methods</h3>
				Controllers are essentially the functionality of your application, and fortunately enough,
				they work so that, unlike some frameworks, they aren't all completely written for you, are 
				customizable, and allow you to create your own applications with your own features. Many
				frameworks seem as if all they require you to do is to give your controller a name, while
				the framework tries to search for a pre-made middleware to try and do what you want. The 
				problem with this is that you aren't able to create your own methods and you might end 
				up hating what the framework comes up with. Fortunately, Enzyme allows for simplicity
				in writing controllers, but maximum control. First of all, we need to analyze how
				we access and use our controllers in Enzyme, and also how the methods are called. By default,
				we should almost always write <i>indexes</i> on our controllers. Indexes, are essentially
				the method that is called without passing a method in the URL. This is important for a few
				reasons. First of all, indexes allows us to keep our URLs less verbose. For example,
				if we had a controller containing the class "Register", and we wanted to have a method in that
				controller/class that shows the view with the registration form, we would need to write
				a method for that. So, if we called that method "showView()", then the user would have to
				land on the URL, "/register/showView". This, of course, is stupid, and verbose. We instead,
				would like to show the registration form by just landing on the URL "/register". This, is 
				where the indexes come in. By creating a method called "index()", we can pass through the 
				code to show the view with the registration form, and access it by just landing on 
				"/register". Our controller would now essentially look like this <br>

				<div class="code">
					&lt;?php
					<br>
					class Register extends Controller {<br>
						&nbsp;public function index()<br>
						&nbsp;{<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp;	// Code goes here<br>
						&nbsp;}<br>
					}
				</div>

				<br>

				So, you may see why this could be useful. However, keep in mind, that we won't always be using
				an index for every page and every request. Obviously, we may inted to use other functions
				to handle POST requests, which we will talk about later in the guide. Now, at this point, it
				isn't hard at all to underestimate the diversity and functionality that we can throw in
				to a controller very quickly. But let me ensure you, that it is quite diverse. The
				main point of a controller in the first place is to interact and poke around with
				the schema that we write, which at the moment, we have none of. Schema is extremely
				important in your applications, and should be used almost all of the time when it
				is applicable. You will see in a second how we can write schema, and also how
				schema can be used with out controllers and methods. In order to begin controlling
				schema, we need to write a model. Because we must learn about it first, we will come
				back to controllers later and talk about how we can manage our schema within
				our controllers.

				<h3>Models And Schema</h3>
				The greatest feature of Enzyme is being lightweight and not depending on a load of frameworks
				that will change how Enzyme works. Instead of adding in Eloquent, we instead wrote our own
				way of interfacing with a database using PDO, and you will see this in a second. In order to
				actually interface with the database and link the database to schema or a model, we need to 
				figure out how models work and then check out how our database component works. We will check
				that out in a second, but for now, it is unimportant, and we can just write models in order
				to control our application without a database. Before, we can begin creating our own
				models, we must first assess why models are important. You can think of a model as a
				table in a database, but much smaller essentially. At the core, it's just a 
				way of organizing your data into multiple instances. We will have a model for
				almost every duplicate type in our application. To simplify this even further,
				we can take an example, such as a user. A large application like Google,
				has well over 100,000,000 users, so as you can imagine a User model would
				be important because there is clearly some duplicates. Of all the things
				that Enzyme has, a model is not a specific device that you have to explicitly
				define before creating. In fact, the only time that we ever use the term
				model, is when linking it to our controller. But, when we create it, we just
				write a class normally, but write it as if we were giving it variables and functions
				that tell us what that model does. So, let's do that! We can easily create a simple
				model by just writing a class and giving it one variable, then using Enzyme's <i>model</i>
				function to do the rest inside of our controller. So, if we want to create
				a model with the name of "User" that takes in a name, we would write the following code
				in our "/app/models" directory
				<br>
				<div class="code">
					&lt;?php
					<br>
					class User {<br>
						&nbsp;public $name;<br>
					}
				</div>

				<br>

				Now, to access this data in the model, and also add it to our instance, we just need to use
				the controller <i>model</i> function which is actually really easy. In our controller, we just
				need to take in a parameter in our URL for a test, and also give it a default value, just in
				case we don't want to pass through a name in our URL. In our controller, we just give the following
				code <br>

				<div class="code">
					&lt;?php
					<br>
					class Register extends Controller {<br>
						&nbsp;public function index($name = '')<br>
						&nbsp;{<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp;	$user = $this->model('User');<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp;	$user->name = $name;<br>
						&nbsp;}<br>
					}
				</div>

				<br>

				By doing this, we are taking the first parameter that we pass through in the URL, and assigning
				the <i>User</i> model's <i>name</i> field to the value of that parameter. Note, that if we 
				pass in a second component of our URL, that does not match the name of a method in the controller
				that we are accessing, then the controller will automatically pass the data as a parameter to the
				index. You have now successfully created a model, and managed the model in your controller. Now,
				let's create views, and manage those inside of our controller.

				<h3>Views</h3>
				Views are probably the most important part of our application, at least to our users. Essentially,
				views are the only way that the user is going to see anything that is in the least bit, aesthetically
				pleasing. However, the common misconception of views is that they are all front end development. While
				that may be close to true, there is data that we should and can pass through to the view in order
				to make our development easier and more manageable by Enzyme itself. Views are extremely easy to 
				implement inside of Enzyme as long as you have a controller and a view that has been written. Inside
				of your "/views" directory, just write a .php file with any front-end code that you want to implement
				inside of it, but make sure that you keep track of any sub-directories (after "/views") that you 
				place the view in. If there isn't any, than you don't have to worry about it, but some people may
				if that is something that you wish to have inside of your views. In your controller, you can just call
				the <i>view</i> function and as a string for the first parameter, pass in any sub-directories (followed
				by a forward slash), and then the name of your view (without the ".php"). You should also keep in mind
				that Enzyme works only with ".php" views because we need to pass in data to our view, which is impossible
				with an HTML file. The second parameter of our <i>view</i> method is an array with any data that we 
				want to send to the view. So, I will pass in the index 'view' and give it the value of our User model's
				name value. Our code should now look like this <br>

				<div class="code">
					&lt;?php
					<br>
					class Register extends Controller {<br>
						&nbsp;public function index($name = '')<br>
						&nbsp;{<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp;	$user = $this->model('User');<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp;	$user->name = $name;<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp;	$this->view('index', ['name' => $user->name]);<br>
						&nbsp;}<br>
					}
				</div>

				<br>

				As you can see, it is very easy to implement views, and I am just sending in a very simple array of data.
				However, at this point we haven't used this data inside of our view. To do this, we only have to add to our 
				view just a little bit. This is the code that I included in my view, and it will just say "Hello" to the name
				of the user (which is the first parameter that we pass through to the index). My view now looks likes this <br>
					<div class="code">
						Hello, &lt;=$data['name']?>.
					</div>

					<br>
				Notice, that you can replace 'name' with the name of the index that you passed through in the array to the view.

				<h3>Linking To Files</h3>
				We are now missing one simple piece of code that we need to implement, and that is any CSS or JavaScript code that
				we would usually see in a web page. Fortunately, Enzyme makes that very easy to do! Linking stylesheets was made
				very easy to do by Enzyme. Due to the fact that views have access to the Enzyme <i>App</i> functions, you can
				call the <i>stylesheet</i> function to link to your stylesheets. Our stylesheets should ALWAYS be placed in
				the "/public/css" directory if you are using CSS. If you are using another CSS pre-processor such as SASS or
				LESS, you should compile the code into CSS and placed into the directory prior to running your application
				(SASS support coming in next version). Whenever you pass the name of your stylesheet into the <i>stylesheet</i>
				method, you don't need to pass a file extension. In my view, I just create a PHP closure and call <i>App::stylesheet('stylesheet')</i>
				as my <i>href</i> in a <i>link</i> tag, to bind the stylesheet "/public/css/stylesheet.css". Your code should
				now look like this in your view <br>
				<div class="code">
						&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="&lt;?php App::stylesheet('stylesheet'); ?&gt;" /&gt;
					</div>

					<br>

					Linking to JavaScript files is just as easy, you just have to call the <i>App::javascript</i> method which
					attaches any JavaScript file (without extension) in the "/public/js" directory. Your code should look
					like this <br>

					<div class="code">
						&lt;script src="&lt;?php App::javascript('script'); ?&gt;"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
					</div>

					<br>
					That's it for linking files, and there's not much more to it.

					<h3>POST Requests</h3>
					POST requests are also easy to handle in Enzyme. However, they work a little bit differently
					than you might expect. When the request is sent, the user should be directed to a URL in order
					to rediret you to a controller and method, where the request will be handeled. Then, it is up
					to you to redirect the user to the correct location afterwards with the correct information.
					For example, if we wanted our view to have a login form that submits a username, we would
					simple create a form with a text field by the name of username and set the action of the
					form to our controller and method. If I wanted to submit to the "login" method of my
					"Auth" controller, my form would look like this <br>

					<div class="code">
						&lt;form action="./auth/login" method="post"&gt;
						<br>
						&nbsp; &lt;input type="text" name="username" /&gt;<br>
						&nbsp; &lt;input type="submit" value="Log In" /&gt;
						<br>
						&lt;/script&gt;
					</div>

					<br>

					Handling the POST data in our controller is also very easy, we just need to use the
					<i>getPostData()</i> method from Enzyme, then we can set a variable to the array
					that the method returns. Your controller would look something like this <br>

					<div class="code">
					&lt;?php
					<br>
					class Auth extends Controller {<br>
						&nbsp;public function login()<br>
						&nbsp;{<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp;	$data = $this->getPostData();<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp;	echo $data['username'];
						&nbsp;}<br>
					}
				</div>

				<br>

				This would just output the username that the user passes into the form. If the
				POST request is null (the user didn't pass any data), then no data will
				be returned by calling <i>getPostData()</i>. Of course, we can also
				redirect the user and send the username that they pass in as the first parameter
				of our <i>home/index</i> method. To do this we just use the <i>route()</i> method.
				It is up to you to change the view to say hello to whatever the user passes in,
				because we just changed the view to have a form, but your controller would look
				like this <br>


					<div class="code">
					&lt;?php
					<br>
					class Auth extends Controller {<br>
						&nbsp;public function login()<br>
						&nbsp;{<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp;	$data = $this->getPostData();<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp;	$this->route('home/'.$data['username']);
						&nbsp;}<br>
					}
				</div>

				<br>


				<h3>Hashing and Verifying Passwords</h3>
				By calling <i>App::hash()</i> and passing in a string, you will receive a hashed
				string with a salt. To verify this with Enzyme, just call <i>App::verify()</i> and
				pass in the hashed, correct password from the database as the first argument, and
				the unhashed, password supplied by the user trying to authenticate themselves as the second.

				<h3>Database</h3>
				Database transactions are extremely easy. All you have to do is reference the Enzyme <i>DB</i>
				class and use it exactly like the PHP <i>PDO</i> class (more database support in next version).
				Migrations are in beta, but not available in this version of Enzyme.

				<h3>That's It Really</h3>
				While you can do a lot with Enzyme, this page has covered all of the features that you need to know about.
				Enzyme 2 is currently in development, enjoy the framework and good luck!

				<h3>New Releases</h3>
				Soon we plan to add plenty of more features. Currently, the only goal really of Enzyme
				is to be extensible and small. Right now, the development team is small (1 person), and
				with that I can't add a load of new features immediately. In fact, I have had trouble implementing
				some features that I would love to include especially as far as security goes. As of right now,
				I am giving priority to adding customizable routes, XSS and CSRF protection, and database support.
				Like I said, I really want to keep this small, and that is the main goal of Enzyme. That's honestly
				why I haven't just thrown in Illuminate with Elqouent to make database transactions, migrations,
				and seeding all easier. I hope that Enzyme can grow as one of the smallest PHP frameworks
				out there, and I am working hard to make PHP a better language.
